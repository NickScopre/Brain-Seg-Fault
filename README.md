# Description
A project for my CS659 class at NJIT. The goal is to implement an image segmentation algorithm from a reference research paper across a wider dataset with the hopes of creating a program to streamline the diagnosis process for MRI brain scans. The project for now will be fully on python and besides standard libraries use Numpy and MatPlotLib.

For the first phase of the project, I will implement and attempt to improve upon the sequence of transformations described in the reference research paper. Later on, I intend to implement a Convolutional Neural Network to predict the diagnosis based on the original image and the segmented image to see how the segmentation changes the ease of diagnosis. 

# To Use
Download the dataset from the Kaggle page listed under "Dataset Used." Download it as a zip file and unzip it. Rename the folder to "input" and place it in the same scope as the downloaded project.
